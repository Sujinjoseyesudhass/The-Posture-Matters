The lower crossed syndrome (LCS) is the result of muscle strength imbalances in the lower segment. These imbalances can occur when muscles are constantly shortened or lengthened in relation to each other. The lower crossed syndrome is characterised by specific patterns of muscle weakness and tightness that cross between the dorsal and the ventral sides of the body. In LCS there is overactivity and hence tightness of hip flexors and lumbar extensors. Along with this there is under activity and weakness of the deep abdominal muscles on the ventral side and of the"," ","gluteus maximus"," ","and medius on the dorsal side.","[1]"," ","The"," ","hamstrings"," ","are frequently found to be tight in this syndrome as well. This imbalance results in an anterior tilt of the"," ","pelvis",", increased flexion of the hips, and a compensatory hyperlordosis in the lumbar spine."," "," ","Upper cross syndrome"," "," ","Upper crossed syndrome (UCS) is defined as altered muscle activation and movement patterns of the head, neck, shoulders and back muscles","[1]","Muscles of neck and chest like suboccipitalis,"," ","sternocleidomastoid"," ","(SCM),"," ","levator scapulae",","," ","pectoralis major"," ","and"," ","minor,"," ","scalenes, and upper"," ","trapezius"," ","(UT) become tight or short and muscles of neck and posterior upper back like deep neck flexors (DNFs),"," ","Serratus Anterior"," ","(SA),"," ","rhomboids",", middle trapezius (MT), and lower trapezius (LT) become stretched, weak and restrained. Tightness and weakness are in a crossed pattern. The tightness of the suboccipitalis, levator scapulae, and UT on the dorsal side is crossed by the tightness of the pectoralis major and minor, SCM, and scalenes on the ventral side; the weakness of DNFs on the ventral side is crossed by the weakness of the SA, rhomboids, MT, and LT","[1]"]],"id":"10"})
